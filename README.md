# ProfLED_web_App
Dear visitor,
this is my web application developed for Professional Led Bologna.
It's buit with PHP5, JS and HTML5/CSS3. 

To try it you need at least a local Web Server (for example Xamp: https://www.apachefriends.org/it/index.html).
First, copy loginPHP in you XAMP_DIR/htdocs/THIS_IS_A_TEST_FOLDER folder.
Then you have to import the sql file in you DB mySql. If you have some credentials setted for you DB you have to change the variables in loginPHP/preventivatore/configUsers.php files (if you use defaul values to login no changes are required).
At now there are two accounts: Manrico (admin) and Dwalin (normalUser).
